# File Organizer Script
A Python script to automatically organize files from the **Downloads** folder into categorized subfolders (e.g., Images, Videos, Documents) based on their file type. This helps keep your Downloads folder clean and your files well-organized.
## Features
- Automatically moves files into pre-defined categories such as:
    - **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.
    - **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.
    - **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, etc.
    - **Archives**: `.zip`, `.rar`, etc.
    - **Music**: `.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.
    - **Others**: Files with unknown extensions.

- Creates target category folders automatically if they don't exist.
- Files with unrecognized extensions are moved to an **Others** folder.
